# 3D-plane-with-different-lighting-condition-and-keyboard-functions-using-OpenGL
This is an OpenGL project using cpp and here I used different OpenGL functions to draw a 3D plane and create a room using circle, ellipse, square, lines, line loops, triangles etc.
Here are also some functionality about lighting effects and keyboard functionality:
The initial scene has ambient light
pressing 2- diffuse light
pressing 3- specular light
small o - panning down
Capital O - panning up
small p- zoom in
capital P- zoom out
small i-panning left
capital I-panning right
small k- rotate about an arbitrary line.
